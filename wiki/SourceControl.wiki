=== Repository contents ===

The repository contains both the current version of Flint and the alpha of the new version of Flint, currently in development.

==== Version 1.0.x ====

The current version, version 1.0.x, is in the repository trunk. This version supports 2D particle effects only. Use this command to anonymously check out the version 1.0.x source code.

{{{svn checkout http://flint-particle-system.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ flint-particle-system-read-only}}}

==== Version 2 alpha ====

The early alpha of version 2 is in a repository branch. This version will support 3D particle effects in addition to 2D particle effects. The 2D contents of this version should be fairly stable, but there is still a lot of work to do on the 3D effects. Use this command to anonymously check out the version 2 alpha source code.
