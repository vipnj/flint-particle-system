### Repository contents ###

The repository contains both the current version of Flint and the alpha of the new version of Flint, currently in development.

#### Version 1.0.4 ####

The final 1.0 release, version 1.0.4, is in the repository tags. This version supports 2D particle effects only. Use this command to anonymously check out the version 1.0.4 source code, examples and documentation.

`svn checkout http://flint-particle-system.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1_0_4/ flint-particle-system-1.0.4-read-only`

#### Version 2 alpha ####

The latest alpha of version 2 is in the repository trunk. This version supports 3D particle effects in addition to 2D particle effects. This version is fairly stable, but is lacking a few features that we intend to add before declaring it a beta release.

`svn checkout http://flint-particle-system.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ flint-particle-system-2-read-only`
